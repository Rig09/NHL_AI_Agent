Environment/Setup
- Complete shell scripts for data install, DB setup + pip env setup
- Outline plan for tests of the setup to ensure consistency

Testing/Performance
- Time each component of the chain while running.

Admin
- Rewrite README
- Request monitoring + managing volume of requests once hosting


STRETCH FEATURES:
Player Cards
- DISCUSS: MoneyPuck skater data only includes the last team that they played for. Does not include the same player's season split over multiple teams.
- Considerations for player card efficiency (calculation, storing, frontend rendering, etc.)
- Player card headshots? https://assets.nhle.com/mugs/nhl/20232024/TOR/8479318.png, or NHL API?
- Per60 Stats
- Correct gradient to BWR

Our Own XG Modelling
- Discuss additional features from new MoneyPuck dataset in XG Modelling
- Explain train/test overlap

MISC STRETCH IDEAS
- If you know a player's XG% you can see how that changes over game stages? (OT, 3rd period, etc). 
    Can also see how well they convert on their XG during those times.
- Input a shot and see the XG from it?
- Heatmaps
    - Player specific 
    - Shot type or location based
- Player similarity/comparisons
- Player progression predictions/forecasting
- Live updating of stats and XG databases?
