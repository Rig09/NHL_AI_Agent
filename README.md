### Data Source

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction

### Model Selection
Leading xG models use Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosted models ([source](https://evolving-hockey.com/blog/a-new-expected-goals-model-for-predicting-goals-in-the-nhl/)). We implmented these approaches with our data, to assess performance relative to existing models (this also verifies that our feature extraction is done correctly, by comparing results to the current state of the art).
