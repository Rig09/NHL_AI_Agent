Agent
- Agent research + development plan
- Text-based interface for agent

Hosting/cloud/live considerations
- Large file storage
- Live updating of stats and XG

Player cards
- DISCUSS: MoneyPuck skater data only includes the last team that they played for. Does not include the same player's season split over multiple teams.
- Considerations for player card efficiency (calculation, storing, frontend rendering, etc.)
- Player card headshots? https://assets.nhle.com/mugs/nhl/20232024/TOR/8479318.png, or NHL API?
- Per60 Stats
- Correct gradient to BWR

XG Modelling
- Discuss additional features from new MoneyPuck dataset in XG Modelling
- Explain train/test overlap

Environment/Setup
- Complete shell scripts for data install and Conda environment [in progress]
- Can env setup be made more efficient with pure pip yml? Is there a need for Conda?
- Outline plan for tests of the setup to ensure consistency

Admin
- Rewrite README
- Request monitoring + managing volume of requests once hosting

Random Ideas:
- If you know a player's XG% you can see how that changes over game stages? (OT, 3rd period, etc). 
    Can also see how well they convert on their XG during those times.
- Input a shot and see the XG from it?
- Heatmaps
    - Player specific 
    - Shot type or location based
- Team Level or Line Level Stats?
- Player similarity/comparisons
- Player progression predictions/forecasting
