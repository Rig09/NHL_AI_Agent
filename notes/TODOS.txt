Current:
- App.py, home.html, allNHLStats.py, and data_processing.ipynb restructuring with new data
    - Merge with new XG model + data format
- Large file storage
- Agent research + development
- Discuss additional features from new MoneyPuck dataset in XG Modelling
- Note: MoneyPuck skater data only includes the last team that they played for. Does not include the same player's season split over multiple teams.

Medium Term:
- Set up repo config with Conda/Pip environment to synchronize packages.
- Text-based interface for agent

Later:
- Rewrite README
- Per60 Stats
- Explain train/test overlap and 
- Player cards
- Live updating of stats and XG
- Request monitoring + managing volume of requests once hosting

Random Ideas:
- If you know a player's XG% you can see how that changes over game stages? (OT, 3rd period, etc). 
    Can also see how well they convert on their XG during those times.
- Input a shot and see the XG from it?
- Heatmaps
    - Player specific 
    - Shot type or location based
- Team Level or Line Level Stats?
